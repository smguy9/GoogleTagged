[color=#660033][b][size=12pt]Introduction[/size][/b][/color]
Every time a visitor is brought to a topic by a major search engine (Google/Yahoo/MSN/Ask/AOL/AllTheWeb), this modification grabs the search terms that were used and stores them.

Eg A visitor may have just searched for 'harry potter'.  If the visitor then clicked on a link to a topic on your forum, that url is often passed to the forum. eg [url]http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=harry+potter[/url]
The script then grabs 'harry potter' and stores them as tags.

A random selection of each topics tags are shown at the bottom each topic. The more visitors who are brought to the topic by the same search terms, the more hits each tag gets, the larger it appears.  Tags which the match those of the visiting users search are also shown in a different color.

[b]This mod will ONLY function properly if your forum[/b]
- is public (eg Most/all of your topics/posts must be viewable to guests so they can be spidered)
- does NOT have a robots.txt which disallows all spiders (as spiders would not be able to spider your site)
- That your forum is relatively well spidered already

The http_referer header isn't always sent by the browser.
Not all servers accept http referrer. It doesn't require register_globals to be on.
